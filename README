==== Scrub Release 1.7 2007-02-14 ====

This version is a significant rewrite since version 1.6.
Major changes in addition to general cleanup and better documentation:

1) Patterns updated

The old scrub patterns satisfied DoD 5220.22-M, but were most appropriate
for older MFM/RLL drive encodings.  The new scrub patterns satisfy
NNSA Policy Letter NAP-14.x, and are appropriate for modern PRML/EPRML
drive encodings.  The old scrub pattern as well as a set of patterns
that minimally satisfies DoD 5220.22-M are selectable via command line option.

2) Random passes improved

The algorithm for generating random bytes has been made more efficient and
more random using an AES counter mode algorithm.

3) Better determination of device size

Prior versions of scrub would determine the capacity of a device by writing
until any error was encountered.  This version determines capacity
using OS-specific ioctls.  The size is overrideable on the command line.

4) OS X improvements

A file's resource fork is scrubbed if it exists.
