Scrub unit tests:

t00 - Verify AES code used to generate random sequences
t01 - Verify large file support by scrubbing a 5G regular file
      with default optins (use --test-sparse to make it fast)
t02 - Scrub a 400K reg file with NNSA NAP-14.1-C
t03 - Scrub a 400K reg file with DoD 5220.22-M
t04 - Scrub a 400K reg file with BSI
t05 - Scrub a 400K reg file with fastold (pre1.7 scrub, no random)
t06 - Scrub a 400K reg file with old (pre1.7 scrub)
t07 - Verify 'scrub signature' checksig()/writesig() functions
t08 - Verify getsize() parsing with units
t09 - Scrub a block device on test systems at LLNL (use --test-sparse)
t10 - Verify size of various block devices on test systems at LLNL
t11 - Scrub a 400K reg file with Gutmann
t12 - Test --device-size on regular file (==, <, > orig size)
t13 - Test scrubbing a directory, scrubbing -X with existing directory,
      and scrubbing a nonexistent file.
t14 - Verify that content of a 4M reg file is fully overwritten
t15 - Scrub a 400K reg file with 16ch custom pattern, and verify with od
t16 - Make sure --dry-run doesn't write
t17 - Scrub mult. files using default options
t18 - Scrub -X on a small tmpfs file system (Linux only)
t19 - Scrub a small loopback device in /tmp (Linux only)
t20 - Scrub a 5G loopback device in /tmp with --test-sparse (Linux only)

Note about test driver:

We use automake's built-in test driver in a very simple way.
Define TESTS as a list of tests to run.  Then "make check" will run
them reporting PASS/FAIL/SKIP based on exit code.  The tests are
named tNN, and usually as a last step in the test, captured output
is compared against expected output in tNN.exp.

These test are being run on buildfarms creating RPM's from the spec
file, so we have to make sure these can run without root, and complete
in a reasonably short time.  We can have exceptions to this for
one-off testing as long as they exit 77 (SKIP exit code) when they are
not being run with appropriate access (see t09, t10).

Test utils:

pad - create a sparse file of some size
    Usage:   ./pad size filename
    Example: ./pad 5g /tmp/foo

tgetsize - get file size / parse file size
    Usage:   ./tgetsize filename
             ./tgetsize size
    Example: ./tgetsize /dev/sda1
             524288000 bytes (~500MB)
             ./tgetsize 4k
             4096 bytes

tsize - stat a file and report its size in bytes
    Usage:   ./tsize filename
    Example: ./tsize /tmp/foo
             5368709120
