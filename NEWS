========================================================================

* Avoid closing and re-opening /dev/urandom [H. Peter Anvin]

* Treat a zero return from write(2) as an error.

* New patterns:
  - random2: two random passes
  - schneier (one 0x00 pass, one 0xff pass, and five random passes) [Joe]

scrub-1.7 Release Notes                                       2006-02-14
========================================================================

NOTE: This version is a significant rewrite since version 1.6.
Major changes in addition to general cleanup and better documentation:

* The new default scrub patterns satisfy NNSA Policy Letter NAP-14.x, 
  and are appropriate for modern PRML/EPRML drive encodings.  
  The old scrub patterns as well as a set of patterns that minimally 
  satisfy DoD 5220.22-M (still appropriate for older MFM/RLL drives)
  are selectable on the command line (-p).

* The algorithm for generating random bytes has been made more efficient 
  and more random using an AES counter mode algorithm.

* Device capacity is determined using OS-specific ioctls.  The size is 
  overrideable on the command line (-s).  

* [Mac OS X only] A file's resource fork is scrubbed if it exists.
